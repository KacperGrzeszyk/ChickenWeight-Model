Objective
The goal of this project is to examine the impact of different diets on the growth rate of chicks over time. The analysis aims to identify which diets support faster weight gain during the first days of life and which diets are more effective in the long term.

Scope of Work
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Descriptive statistics and visualizations.

Comparison of weight distributions across different diets.

Statistical modeling – ANOVA and post-hoc tests (Tukey HSD) to determine which diets differ significantly from each other.

Interpretation of results and conclusions.

Data Source
The dataset used is ChickWeight, a classical educational dataset sourced from:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vincentarelbundock/Rdatasets/master/csv/datasets/ChickWeight.csv
It contains information about chick weights (weight) measured at different time points (Time), categorized by individual chicks (Chick) and diet type (Diet).

Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Sikit-learn
Statsmodels

Key Steps
Data loading and inspection,
Visualization of weight trends over time by diet,
Statistical analysis including ANOVA and Tukey HSD tests,
Preparation of a predictive model,
Interpretation of diet effectiveness
